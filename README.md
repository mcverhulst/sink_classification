# Image Classification using Deep Learning

### The goal
* Classify images as **kitchen** sinks or **bathroom** sinks

### The tools
* Python
* Keras
* MobileNet V2

### About
The goal of this project is to use deep learning to perform image classification. More specifically, this project will use deep learning to classify kitchen sinks from bathroom sinks. This was a class project fo SI 670 at University of Michigan and all the images were sourced from the students in the class.

This project uses a pretrained model to aid with the classification task and closely follows this [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning).

#### The final predictions from this project were evaluated on Kaggle as part of the project. Using this notebook, our team achieved **98%** accuracy.
